# Vehicle Sales Exploratory Data Analysis

The [Vehicle Sales and Market Trends Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data) dataset is a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, published by Syed Anwar in February 2024. It provides a comprehensive collection of information about the sales transactions of various vehicles from the years 2014 to 2015. This dataset encompasses details such as the manufacture year, make, model, trim, body type, transmission type, VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), state of registration, condition rating, odometer reading, exterior and interior colors, seller information, Manheim Market Report (MMR) values, selling prices, and sale dates.

This data science project aims to perform exploratory market analysis on the Automotive Market, gleaning insight into consumer preferences and demands, sales trends, and pricing fluctuations based on various factors. The resulting insights can help automotive dealers and industry professionals better understand consumer preferences and make informed decisions on catering to their needs.

    <p><i>What is the disparity between the annual average reported market prices and the selling prices of vehicles from 2014 to 2015, and what has been the overall trend?</i></p>
    <div align="center">
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heischichou/Vehicle-Sales-Analysis/main/assets/Market%20Vs%20Selling%20Price.png"></img>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;The results indicate that between 2014 and 2015, both the annual average reported market and selling prices of vehicles rose in value. Moreover, analyzing the annual average reported market and selling prices during that time reveals a fascinating trend. In 2014, the average market price was $12,945.37, while the average selling price was slightly lower at $12,735.92, resulting in a disparity of $209.45. Meanwhile, in 2015, the average market price increased to $13,903.61, and the average selling price also increased to $13,768.14, resulting in a smaller disparity of $135.47. These findings suggest that vehicles are being sold at prices closer to their market price in 2015 compared to 2014; this implies that the disparity between the average reported market prices and the average selling prices of vehicles is narrowing over time.</p>

  <p><i>What are the quarterly sales figures over the years?</i></p>

    </div>
    <br>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;The results indicate a significant increase in sales from the beginning of 2014 to its end, with Q4 showing a substantial spike in total sales and the number of vehicles sold compared to earlier quarters.</p>
    <p align="justify">In Q1 of 2014, the automotive market saw a strong performance in January, recording $1.56 billion in sales and 117,354 vehicles sold. However, sales figures in February experienced a drastic drop in sales, presenting only $10,500 in revenue from 1 vehicle sold; this perceived sharp plunge is likely due to an unclear external factor.</p>
    <p align="justify">The absence of sales data for Q3 and Q4 limits the comprehensive analysis of the year's sales performance. Alternatively, it could suggest that potential seasonal variations or market-specific influences may have influenced consumer purchasing behavior throughout the year. Further accounting and analysis could provide deeper insights into the underlying factors driving these fluctuations and provide a more comprehensive explanation.</p>

    <p align="justify">The results overall demonstrate the fluctuations in vehicle sales and suggest potential seasonal trends or external factors that may have influenced sales patterns in the automotive market during 2015, with the second quarter showing the best performance.</p>

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;As seen above in the figures above, the results on the top 3 highest-grossing and highest-selling vehicle types (Sedan, SUV, and CrewCab) by manufacture year from 2011 to 2015 demonstrate the following insights:</p>
  <ul>
    <li align="justify">Across their manufacturing years, Sedans are consistently the highest-grossing and highest-selling vehicle type at 206,429 units sold for $2.4 billion in total revenue. SUVs follow behind at 117,229 units sold for $1.89 billion in revenue, and CrewCabs at 13,627 units sold for $296 million. These figures suggest that Sedans are the prime choice of vehicle in the automotive industry among consumers, manufacturers, and dealers alike, and continue to generate significant demand and revenue regardless of their manufacture year.</li>
    <li align="justify">There are considerable variances in sales among distinct manufacturing years, indicating fluctuations in market demand. Notably, as newer vehicle models enter the market and displace older models, cumulative sales experienced a downward trend in revenue and the number of units sold; this implies that consumers prefer to purchase older models, or possibly, there is a decline in the automotive market over time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify">These results overall show that the United States is a lucrative market for vehicle dealers and manufacturers.</p>
